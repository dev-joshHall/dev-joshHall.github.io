##Personal Profile Webpage

This project is to demonstrate my abilities in Web Developement that I have achieved in the past couple months.

This will be a webpage that represents a basic profile of myself.


##Styling

1. I chose to do a little of the "artistic portrait" principle by left-aligning my photo and having some of the text wrap around it.
2. I chose to add a sticky footer using a calc() reduced height wrapper.
3. I indented my poem.
4. I color coded the items on my schedule by classes and work.
5. All text switched to sans-serif font.
